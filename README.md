Quick Watermark is a free desktop application built with Electron/Vite. It allows the user to quickly add a text watermark to any image they upload. The watermark location can be changed between multiple preset locations. The font size, color and opacity can also be changed easily. 

Please check out the latest release in order to download the app! Thanks for looking and hope you enjoy the application! Feel free to report any bugs or enhancements you can think of.
